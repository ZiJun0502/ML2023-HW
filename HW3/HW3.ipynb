However, if you use the softmax and the cross entropy loss, that complexity fades away. Since the softmax layer is usually used at the output, we can actually calculate the derivative of the categorical cross-entropy loss with respect to the n-th node in the last hidden layer. Instead of a long clunky formula, you end up with this terse, easy to compute thing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial Z_i} = s_i - y_i $$, where $s$ is the output of the softmax function and the $y$ is the true label vector(one-hot vector). For more information, you can refer to this article [Derivative of the Softmax Function and the Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/derivative-of-the-softmax-function-and-the-categorical-cross-entropy-loss-ffceefc081d1). <br>\n","❗**Important**❗: The above mathematical derivation is based on naive implementation.

Model backward (4%)\n","Now you will implement the backward function for the whole network. Recall that you have implemented the backward function for the dense and activation function layer. In this section, you will call these functions to help you implement the model backward function. You will iterate through all the hidden layers backward, starting from layer $L$. On each step, you will call the backward function of layer $l$ to backpropagate through layer $l$.\n","\n","**Exercise**: Implement model backward.\n","\n","**Instruction**:\n","*   Use the functions you had previously written.\n","*   Initialize backpropagation.\n","*   Use a for loop to backprop from layer $L-1$ to layer $1$.\n","\n","Initializing backpropagation:\n","\n","(1) **Binary classification**: To backpropagate through this network, we know that the output is, $A^{[L]} = \\sigma(Z^{[L]})$. Your code thus needs to compute dAL $= \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial A^{[L]}}$. To do so, use the formulas (derived using calculus which you don't need in-depth knowledge of):\n","```\n","dAL = - (np.divide(Y, AL + ϵ) - np.divide(1 - Y, 1 - AL + ϵ)) # derivative of loss with respect to AL, where ϵ = 1e-5 is added to prevent zero division.\n","```\n","You can then use this post-activation gradient dAL to keep going backward. You can now feed in dAL into the LINEAR->SIGMOID backward function you implemented (which will use the cached values stored inside each layer in the forward pass). After that, you will have to use a for loop to iterate through all the other layers using the LINEAR->RELU backward function.\n","\n","(2) **Multi-class classification**: Since you have implemented the backward function of the softmax activation function layer along with the categorical cross-entropy loss (same with focal loss), you can directly call the softmax_CCE_backward function implemented inside the activation function layer and followed by the linear backward function to obtain the post-activation gradient to keep going backward. After that, you will have to use a for loop to iterate through all the other layers using the LINEAR->RELU backward function.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":986,"metadata":{"id":"HOGsyLXPNGh5"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["sigmoid:\n","dA_prev = [[ 0.55554938  0.27777469]\n"," [ 0.49152369  0.24576184]\n"," [-0.41996594 -0.20998297]\n"," [-0.55554938 -0.27777469]\n"," [-0.39321993 -0.19660997]]\n","dW = [[-0.29446117]\n"," [ 0.29446117]]\n","db = [[-0.03216622]]\n","\n","relu:\n","dA_prev = [[-0.01269296 -0.05595562]\n"," [ 0.01470136  0.06480946]\n"," [ 0.          0.        ]\n"," [-0.07496777 -0.0327431 ]\n"," [-0.07151883 -0.03123674]]\n","dW = [[ 0.0178719  -0.17321413]\n"," [-0.0178719   0.17321413]]\n","db = [[ 0.00335943 -0.11638953]]\n","\n"]}],"source":["AL, Y, linear_activation_cache = np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.5], [0.9], [1.0]]), np.array([[0], [0], [1], [1], [1]]), (((np.array([[-2, 2], [-1, 1], [0, 0], [1, -1], [2, -2]]), np.array([[2.0], [1.0]]), np.array([[0.5]])), np.array([[0], [1], [2], [0], [1]])))\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].cache = linear_activation_cache[0]\n","model.activation[0].cache = linear_activation_cache[1]\n","dA_prev = model.backward(AL=AL, Y=Y)\n","print (\"sigmoid:\")\n","print (\"dA_prev = \"+ str(dA_prev))\n","print (\"dW = \" + str(model.linear[0].dW))\n","print (\"db = \" + str(model.linear[0].db) + \"\\n\")\n","AL, Y, linear_activation_cache = np.array([[0.35], [0.93], [0.23], [0.72], [0.90]]), np.array([[1], [0], [1], [0], [1]]), (((np.array([[-1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 0], [1, -4], [3, -2]]), np.array([[1.7], [3.2]]), np.array([[0.25]])), np.array([[2], [1], [2], [0], [0]])))\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].cache = linear_activation_cache[0]\n","model.activation[0].cache = linear_activation_cache[1]\n","dA_prev = model.backward(AL=AL, Y=Y)\n","outputs[\"model_backward_sigmoid\"] = (dA_prev, model.linear[0].dW, model.linear[0].db)\n","\n","X, Y = np.array([[-2, 2], [-1, 1], [0, 0], [1, -1], [2, -2]]), np.array([[0], [1], [1], [1], [1]])\n","model = Model([2, 2, 1], [\"relu\", \"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","dA_prev = model.backward(AL=AL, Y=Y)\n","print (\"relu:\")\n","print (\"dA_prev = \"+ str(dA_prev))\n","print (\"dW = \" + str(model.linear[0].dW))\n","print (\"db = \" + str(model.linear[0].db) + \"\\n\")\n","X, Y = np.array([[4.56, -3.21], [-7.85, 6.34], [2.45, -8.90], [5.67, 3.12], [-4.78, 7.89]]), np.array([[1], [1], [0], [1], [0]])\n","model = Model([2, 2, 1], [\"relu\", \"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","dA_prev = model.backward(AL=AL, Y=Y)\n","outputs[\"model_backward_relu\"] = (dA_prev, model.linear[0].dW, model.linear[0].db)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o6xzEk3-NGh6"},"source":["Expected output:\n","<table>\n","  <tr>\n","    <th colspan=\"2\">Sigmoid</th>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>dA_prev:</td>\n","    <td>[[ 0.55554938  0.27777469] [ 0.49152369  0.24576184] [-0.41996594 -0.20998297] [-0.55554938 -0.27777469] [-0.39321993 -0.19660997]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>dW:</td>\n","    <td>[[-0.29446117] [ 0.29446117]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>db:</td>\n","    <td>[[-0.03216622]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <th colspan=\"2\">ReLU</th>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>dA_prev:</td>\n","    <td>[[-0.01269296 -0.05595562] [ 0.01470136  0.06480946] [ 0.  0. ] [-0.07496777 -0.0327431 ] [-0.07151883 -0.03123674]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>dW:</td>\n","    <td>[[ 0.0178719  -0.17321413] [-0.0178719   0.17321413]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>db:</td>\n","    <td>[[ 0.00335943 -0.11638953]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":987,"metadata":{"id":"BC1QnMSKN2wZ"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Binary classification -

Advanced implementation (multi class classification) (15%)\n","\n","In this section, you need to implement a multi-class classifier using the functions you had previously written. You will create a model that can classify ten handwritten digits. The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset in computer vision and deep learning. We usually use convolutional deep-learning neural networks for image classification. However, using only dense layers appears to be enough to handle this simple dataset, and this is a good way to get started with image datasets.\n","\n","**Exercise**: Implement a multi-class classifier and tune hyperparameter.\n","\n","**Instruction**:\n","*   Use the functions you had previously written.\n","*   Preprocess the data to match the correct input format.\n","*   Use mini-batch gradient descent to train the model.\n","\n","**Hint**:\n","For data preprocessing, please be careful with the dimension of the inputs (X and y) and also note that the values of images are usually integers that fall between 0 and 255. You need to change the data type into float and scale the values between 0 and 1.\n","\n","In Batch Gradient Descent, we consider all the samples for every step of Gradient Descent. But what if our dataset is huge? You will get around 33000 training samples, then to take one step, the model will have to calculate the gradients of all the 33000 samples. This does not seem an efficient way.
